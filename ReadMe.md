<h1>Traversy School App</h1>

<br>

<p>
This ia simple project based on Brad Traversy's course called "Node.js API Masterclass with Express & MongoDB" on <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/nodejs-api-masterclass/">Udemy</a>. I modified seveal of the features to make it a bit more unique. It is a back-end for an application that allows registered users to add universities to a database, then associate professors with each school.

The API was developed and tested with Postman. The API will be explained at the url <a href="https://mwatson-school-app.herokuapp.com/">mwatson-school-app.heroku-app.com</a> (coming soon).
